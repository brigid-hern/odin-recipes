        <h3> Description </h3>
        <p> This is a crowd pleaser, and my go to meal for feeding large numbers of people. Easily scalable, and a great way to handle that mid-summer cherry tomato influx that happens to all gardeners. </p>
        <p> Pro tip: If you're feeling brave, sub out the feta block in this recipe for Boursin. It's a great substitute that adds the creamiest texture!  </p>
        <h4> Ingredients </h4>
        <ul> 
            <li> 2 pints cherry tomatoes </li>
            <li> 1 cup olive oil </li>
            <li> One block of feta </li>
            <li> Two cloves of garlic, smashed </li>
            <li> Half a shallot, diced  </li>
            <li> Red pepper flakes, salt and pepper to taste </li>
            <li> Lemon zest </li>
            <li> 1 package of farfalle or any other sauce-catching pasta  </li>
        </ul>
        <h4> Steps </h4>
        <ol> 
            <li> Preheat the oven to 425. </li>
            <li> In a deep, oven safe dish, combine the cherry tomatoes, garlic and shallot with 3 tablespoons of olive oil. Roll them around to coat.  </li>
            <li> In the center of the pan, add the block of feta. Pour additional olive oil over top, and season the entire pan with red pepper flakes. </li>
            <li> Place in the middle rack of the oven and let bake for 45 minutes. </li>
            <li> Before the feta is done baking, cook your pasta. Save about half a cup of pasta water in a measuring cup for later.  </li>
            <li> Once your feta is looking golden, your tomatoes and blistered and breaking open, your feta dish is done. Take it out of the oven. </li>
            <li> With the back of a heat-safe spoon, break open the tomatoes and stir the feta. It should be creamy and melted, and will easily stir into a sauce. </li>
            <li> Add your pasta. If the sauce seems a bit thick add some of the reserved pasta water. </li>
            <li> Season the pasta and sauce with about a tablespoon of lemon zest. Add a generous handful of salt and some pepper.  </li>
            <li> Taste for seasoning. </li>
            <li> Serve with a side veggie, or on its own. Enjoy! </li>
        </ol>
