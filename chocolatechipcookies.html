        <h3> Description </h3>
        <p> This recipe will remind you of the comfort food of childhood with slightly more depth of flavor. Emphasizing adding texture, acidity and proper salinity, the innate flavors of this beloved cookie soar. </p>
        <p> A note before you begin, its advised that your eggs and butter are at room temperature. The easiest way to do this is to put the eggs and butter for this recipe out on the counter a few hours before. But let's be realistic, some days you just don't have the time. To speed up the process, run your eggs under room temp water until they are no longer cool to the touch. And for heating your butter, put the still-packaged sticks in a microwave. Turn them every 5 seconds, and repeat until they are soft to the touch but not liquid. </p>
        <h4> Ingredients </h4>
        <ul> 
            <li> One cup of unsalted butter, softened (two sticks) </li>
            <li> A cup and a half of light brown sugar </li>
            <li> A half cup of white sugar </li>
            <li> Two and a half tbsp of vanilla extract </li>
            <li> One tsp of salt </li>
            <li> One tsp baking powder </li>
            <li> One tsp baking soda </li>
            <li> Two eggs, room temperature </li>
            <li> Two and 1/2 cups of flour (plus one tbsp) </li>
            <li> Two cups of chocolate chips (I use 1 cup semi-sweet morsels and 1 cup mini-morsels) </li>
        </ul>
        <h4> Steps </h4>
        <ol> 
            <li> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees fahrenheit. </li>
            <li>  In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine butter, brown sugar and white sugar. Mix on medium for five minutes, until fluffy and incorporated. </li>
            <li> Add vanilla extra, salt, baking powder, and baking soda to the standmixer bowl. Mix on medium for one minute. </li>
            <li> Add the eggs to the bowl of the standmixer one at a time. Beat until just incorporated. Do not overbeat.</li>
            <li> Add the flour 1/2 cup at a time. The texture should be slightly sticky, but not enough to stick to your hand completely.  </li>
            <li> Add the chocolate chips. </li>
            <li> Place your cookies on a light colored baking tray. Each cookie should be slightly smaller than a golf ball. </li>
            <li> Bake for 11 to 15 minutes, turning the tray halfway through. The cookies should look browned on the edges but slightly undercooked in the center.  </li>
            <li> Let rest on the tray to finish baking for five minutes. Move to a wire rack to finish cooling. </li>
            <li> Enjoy! </li>
        </ol>
